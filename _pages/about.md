I'm Eli≈°ka, a junior developer with a fresh perspective and a love for turning complex problems into clean, efficient code. I thrive on debugging challenges and enjoy making tangible progress, one commit at a time. My experience in digital marketing taught me to think about the end-user, while my current role as a Junior Developer at OUSHI UPOL allows me to build and refine applications. I built this site to put my skills in HTML, CSS, version control, and CI/CD into practice, and because I'm genuinely excited to build things that work and look good. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
